      <p1> “ After completing a Phd in theoretical physics i have been interested in data analysis and data science. With a strong background in statistics, analytics and programming, i have been able to explore and develop capabilities in understanding data systems, data mining, using statistical tools to interpret data sets and data visualisation and presentation. I have experience in data analysis by way of a traineeship, which has helped me develop technical capabilities in data analysis and data mining with different tools like excel , access , sql server , Power bi and Dax. My knowledge of programming and scripting languages such as Python have helped me simplify the work. As a Physics researcher, i have also the ability to investigate a problem and find the ideal and creative solutions. On the other hand, my experience in teaching helped me develop good verbal and written communication skills.” </p1>
